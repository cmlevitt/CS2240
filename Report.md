# Project 1 Report

Answer the following prompts directly in this file:
* What each of the 5+ attributes of your dataset represent.
  * My 5 attributes are related to characters in my favorite manga/anime, One Piece. The first column is simply numbered,
  the second is the characters name. Following that is the manga chapter number they first appeared in, anime episode number they
  first appeared in, and then the year of the characters first appearance in the story. 
* Where you got the data from.
  * I got this data set from Kaggle, there were limited options for my chosen topic and this dataset seemed most comprehensive
  of those available
* Why you chose that dataset.   
  * I chose this dataset because it was fun for me, it is information about a story I love and I enjoyed learning a
  little bit more about it and working with the data.
* How the rows are ordered by default (i.e. is the data sorted by a particular column?).
  * The rows are sorted by character name alphabetically A-Z (These are the english translations of names from a japanese series).
* How you know your functions work correctly.
  * My function for the first and last name alphabetically in the dataset works because I can look at my printed dataset, 
  as well as scroll to the bottom of the list and see which is the last entry.
* Why you chose that calculation for your dataset.
  * This made the most sense because the characters names are the primary column of interest, and a unique identifier among the data.
